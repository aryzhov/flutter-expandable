# Expandable

A Flutter widget that can be expanded or collapsed by the user.

## Introduction

This library helps implement expandable behavior as prescribed by Material Design:

* [Motion > Choreography > Transformation](https://material.io/design/motion/choreography.html#transformation)
* [Components > Cards > Behavior](https://material.io/design/components/cards.html#behavior)

`Expandable` should not be confused with 
[ExpansionPanel](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ExpansionPanel-class.html) . 
`ExpansionPanel`, which is a part of
Flutter material library, is designed to work only within `ExpansionPanelList` and cannot be used
for making other widgets, for example, expandable Card widgets.


## Usage

The easiest way to make an expandable widget is to use `ExpandablePanel`:

```dart
class ArticleWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  
  final Article article;
  
  ArticleWidget(this.article);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ExpandablePanel(
      header: Text(article.title),
      collapsed: Text(article.body, softWrap: true, maxLines: 2, overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,),
      expanded: Text(article.body, softWrap: true, ),
      tapHeaderToExpand: true,
      hasIcon: true,
    );
  }
}
```
`ExpandablePanel` has a number of properties to customize its behavior, but it's restricted by 
having a title at the top and an expand icon shown as a down arrow (on the right or on the left). 
If that's not enough, you can implement custom expandable widgets by using a combination of `Expandable`,
`ExpandableNotifier`, and `ExpandableButton`: 

```dart
class EventPhotos extends StatelessWidget {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ExpandableNotifier(  // <-- Provides ExpandableController to its children
      child: Column(
        children: [
          Expandable(           // <-- Driven by ExpandableController from ExpandableNotifier
            collapsed: ExpandableButton(  // <-- Expands when tapped on the cover photo
              child: buildCoverPhoto(),
            ),
            expanded: Column(  
              children: [
                buildAllPhotos(),
                ExpandableButton(       // <-- Collapses when tapped on
                  child: Text("Back"),
                ),
              ]
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Automatic Scrolling

Expandable widgets are often used within a scroll view. When the user expands a widget, be it
an `ExpandablePanel` or an `Expandable` with a custom control, they expect the expanded
widget to fit within the viewable area (if possible). For example, if you show a list of 
articles with a summary of each article, and the user expands an article to read it, they
expect the expanded article to occupy as much screen space as possible. The **Expandable** 
package contains a widget to help implement this behavior, `ScrollOnExpand`. 
Here's how to use it:

```dart
   ExpandableNotifier(      // <-- This is where your controller lives
     //...
     ScrollOnExpand(        // <-- Wraps the widget to scroll
      //...
        ExpandablePanel(    // <-- Your Expandable or ExpandablePanel
          //...
        )
     )
  )
```

Why a separate widget, you might ask? Because generally you might want to show not just 
the expanded widget but its container, for example a `Card` that contains it.
See the example app for more details on the usage of `ScrollOnExpand`.

## Themes

Version 4.0 introduced themes to expandable widgets. Themes greatly simplify visual customization 
and as well as future extensibility. Each expandable widget can get its theme data directly via 
the constructor or from the nearest `ExpandableTheme` widget:

```dart
  ExpandableTheme(
    data: ExpandableThemeData(
        iconColor: Colors.red, 
        animationDuration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500)
    ),
      // ...
      Expandable(  // 500 milliseconds animation duration
      ),

      // ...
      ExpandablePanel(  // <-- Blue icon color, 500 milliseconds animation duration
        theme: ExpandableThemeData(iconColor: Colors.blue),
  
      ),
  )
```
`ExpandableTheme` widgets can be nested, in which case inner definitions override outer definitions.
There is a default theme with fallback values defined in `ExpandableThemeData.defaults`.

Prior to version 4.0, theme parameters were passed to widget constructors directly. These parameters
are now deprecated and will be removed in the next release. 

## Icon Customization

There are several theme properties that help customize the expand/collapse icon:
*  `hasIcon` - should the icon be shown in the header of [ExpandablePanel];
*  `iconSize` - icon size;
*  `iconColor` - icon color;
*  `iconPadding` - icon padding;
*  `iconPlacement` - icon placement in the header;
*  `iconRotationAngle` - the angle to which to rotate the icon;
*  `expandIcon` - icon face to use in the collapsed state;
*  `collapseIcon` - icon face to use in the expanded state.

When specifying a custom icon, you have the option to use the same icon for expand/collapse or 
to use two different icons. If using the same icon, specify the same value for `expandIcon` and `collapseIcon`, and
that icon will be shown as-is in the collapsed state and upside-down in the expanded state.
